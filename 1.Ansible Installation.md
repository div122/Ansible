**Pre-requisites:**

An AWS EC2 instance (on Control node)

**Installation steps:** on Amazon EC2 instance

1.Install python and python-pip

yum install python

yum install python-pip

2.Install ansible using pip check for version

pip install ansible

ansible --version

3.Create a user called ansadmin (on Control node and Managed host)

useradd ansadmin

passwd ansadmin

4.Below command grant sudo access to ansadmin user. But we strongly recommended using "visudo" command if you are aware vi or nano editor.
(on Control node and Managed host)

echo "ansadmin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers

5.Log in as a ansadmin user on master and generate ssh key (on Control node)

sudo su - ansadmin

ssh-keygen

6.Copy keys onto all ansible managed hosts (on Control node)

ssh-copy-id ansadmin@<target-server>

7.Ansible server used to create images and store on docker registry. Hence install docker, start docker services and add ansadmin to the docker group.

yum install docker
  
# status docker services
  
service docker status  
  
# start docker services
  
service docker start
 
# add user to docker group 
  
usermod -aG docker ansadmin
  
8.Create a directory /etc/ansible and create an inventory file called "hosts" add control node and managed hosts IP addresses to it.

**Validation test:**
  
Run ansible command as ansadmin user it should be successful (Master)
  
ansible all -m ping
